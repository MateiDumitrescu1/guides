# setup ssh  
## ubuntu  
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
sudo systemctl status ssh
```
# configure shared folders
1. add a shared folder, tick auto-mount when making it 
2. install virtual box guest additions 

for debian 12: https://itslinuxfoss.com/install-virtualbox-guest-additions-debian-12/

reboot
```bash
sudo reboot
```
Add yourself to the vboxsf group within the guest VM.
then reboot
```bash
sudo adduser $USER vboxsf
sudo reboot
```

Check out the shared folder on the Guest!! It will be called sf_something
```bash
cd /media
ls -a
```
# user is not in sudoers file


# setup ssh from host to guest: port forwarding 
in virtualbox, click on a vm -> settings -> network -> expand the "Advanced" menu -> port forwarding -> add a rule with "Host Port" = 2222, "Guest Port" = 22
then you can 
```bash
ssh -p 2222 username@localhost"
```


# to use docker without sudo -> create a user group called docker, add current user to it 
```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

# assign static ip to vm in virtualbox


# check if docker, or just moby-engine is installed 
```bash
dpkg -l | grep -i docker
```
You should see a lot of docker packages if docker in installed, or just moby-engine
